## Overview

This repository showcases my solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge to build a responsive blog preview card resembling the provided design. The aim was to create a visually appealing and interactive component that adheres to best practices.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The card adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal appearance on various devices.
Hover and Focus States: Interactive element on the blog heading.
Semantic HTML: The layout is structured using semantic tags, improving readability and maintainability.
Clean CSS: Styles are organized and well-structured, making them easy to understand and modify.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Leveraging the power of CSS, I harnessed the versatility of Flexbox to construct the component's layout. Flexbox's inherent flexibility allowed me to create a responsive and adaptable structure that would gracefully adjust to diverse screen sizes and device orientations.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Throughout the development process, I discovered the REM rule of 62.5%, a valuable principle for efficient font sizing. By aligning font sizes with a base REM value, I maintained consistency and scalability, simplifying future adjustments and preventing font-related issues on different devices.
